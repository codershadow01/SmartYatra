## Overview

The current absence of a user-friendly and efficient system for navigating public transportation, especially in unfamiliar cities, poses significant challenges for travelers. Often, individuals resort to expensive private transportation options due to the lack of accessible information and convenience provided by public transit.

By providing users with information about different routes and nearby services, SmartYatra revolutionizes the way people commute. Whether users are at home, work, or exploring a new city, they can easily access vital transit details, enabling them to make informed decisions and plan their journeys more effectively.

Also, SmartYatra will promote more use of public transport which will help in reducing traffic congestion and hence, result in less pollution, cleaner & healthy environment.
